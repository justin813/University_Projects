This program is to demonstrate knowledge and practice with the SIC/XE language.

Goal:	To reverse a string

Implementation:	I load a string through many words. 
	Then I use a loop to go through each word and place it in a 10 word variable
	in reverse. The oringal string starts at 130 to 151. The reversed strig starts
	at 151 to 16f. In my case the string is 10 words long. And the List of  is 
	defined from the word NUMS which has all the remaing words below it and then
	displays the string in reverse.

Modifications for increase/decreasing string size and words to reverse: 
	x = number of words. NUMS = Words
	1. modify the word MEM to 3*x.
	2. In addition modify variable INV to x
	3. Modify NUMS to hold x number items.
	
	E.g. I want to reverse a 12 word string.
	x = 12;
	1. MEM WORD 36
	2. INV RESW 12
	3. NUMS WORD 10
			WORD 13
			WORD 13
			WORD 13
			WORD 13
			WORD 13
